# ai-bot
This repository contains all the code our team developed for the [2020
AI-bot challenge](ai-bot.ir), which receives an input question, recognizes the
question's category, and answers it. There are some specifications relating to 
how you should ask a question which will be explained later on.

## Our Team
Before moving on to the details, you should know who we are.
- [Azin Azarkar](https://github.com/azinazarkar)
- [Hamed Khaledi](https://github.com/hamedkhaledi)
- [Matin Zivdar](https://github.com/zivdar001matin)
- And me.

Azin and I developed the category recognition while Hamed and Matin figured out 
which entities are in the questions to produce the corresponding output.
